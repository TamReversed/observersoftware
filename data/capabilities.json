    "longDescription": "## Transform Your Data Workflow\n\nDataDragon watches how your team actually uses data—the exports, the manual joins, the \"let me just check this in Excel\" moments—and removes the friction.\n\n### How It Works\n\nInstead of building yet another dashboard, DataDragon focuses on the questions your team asks repeatedly. It learns the patterns, pre-computes the answers, and surfaces them before you have to search.\n\n### Built for Reality\n\nMost BI tools assume clean data and patient users. DataDragon assumes neither. It handles messy inputs, explains its reasoning, and gets out of the way.",

    "longDescription": "## Workflow Without the Work\n\nTableFlow emerged from watching people copy-paste between systems, maintain shadow spreadsheets, and build elaborate workarounds for inflexible software.\n\n### The Observer Approach\n\nWe don't start with a blank canvas. We watch the existing workflow, identify where data gets stuck or duplicated, and remove those friction points surgically.\n\n### One Source of Truth\n\nTableFlow ensures that data entered once flows to every system that needs it. No re-keying, no sync errors, no \"which version is correct?\" conversations.",
